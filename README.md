# UEHotfixResearch
 Research on hotfixes for games using Unreal Engine's [Hotfix](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Plugins/Hotfix/) plugin.

 I am actively writing this research for Fortnite, for only the interesting/useful keys. 

# Track the Hotfixes
- Fortnite: [NiteStats](https://discord.gg/wJp9ZEp)
- Fortnite: [Epic Server Version Status](https://discord.gg/z9TPuevz6s)

# Contribute
 Feel free to contribute to this research with any valid piece of information at any time! Adding notes with a useful explaination for the keys would also be appreciated!
